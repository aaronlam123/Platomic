#
# SpinFlag determines whether the calculation is to be spin polarized or not.
#  0  ==>  Not spin polarized
#  1  ==>  Collinear Spin
#  2  ==>  Non-collinear spin
# If SpinFlag = 1, then a list of the initial net spin on each atom is required.
# The spin of an electron is (of course) 0.5. If you have a list of identical
# spin values, you can compress the list by writing (for example)
#   0.5 * 15
# This will give 15 identical spins. NOTE: you need the spaces on either side
# of the *
# If SpinFlag = 2, then a list of the initial net spin vectors on each atom is
# required (x, y and z components).
#
# LSDApUFlag determines if the correlation correction (U-J) is to be used.
#  0  ==>  Ordinary TB
#  1  ==>  TB plus U
#
# DataSet is the name of the subdirectory of the main directory in which the 
# data files are kept for the chosen model.
#
# OccupyFlag determines how the occupancies of the single particle states are
# assigned.

#  3  ==>  Find occupancies using Paxton-Methfessel scheme with
#          broadening given by ElectronTemperature. Following number is the
#          order of the polynomial used.

#          temperature given by ElectronTemperature and a fixed
#          total spin.  Only valid for SpinFlag = 1. Following number is the
#          the total spin.
#
# OccupyTolerance sets the tolerance on the number of electrons used when
# searching for the Fermi energy
#
# ElectronTemperature is the temperature (in Ry) that the electrons are given
# to smooth the finding of the Fermi level.
#
# BlochStates is the flag marking the list of quantities to define the k points
# to be used for a periodic calculation. Zero K points means Bloch states are
# not to be used. A positive number means that you must provide a list with
# this many K points (in reduced coordinates) with their weights (k1,k2,k3,wt)
# A value of -1 means that a Monkhorst-Pack mesh will be generated for you. You
# must provide three integers giving the number of points in each direction.
#
# ElectronExcess is the number of extra electrons to be added to the system over
# and above those contributed by the neutral atoms.
#
# MagneticField gives the magnitude of the uniform magnetic field along the z
# direction. Its value is \mu_B B in units of Rydberg.
