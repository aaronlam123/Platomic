#
# SpinFlag determines whether the calculation is to be spin polarized or not.
#  0  ==>  Not spin polarized

#  2  ==>  Non-collinear spin
# If SpinFlag = 1, then a list of the initial net spin on each atom is required.
# The spin of an electron is (of course) 0.5. If you have a list of identical
# spin values, you can compress the list by writing (for example)
#   0.5 * 15
# This will give 15 identical spins. NOTE: you need the spaces on either side
# of the *
# If SpinFlag = 2, then a list of the initial net spin vectors on each atom is
# required (x, y and z components).
#
# LSDApUFlag determines if the correlation correction (U-J) is to be used.
#  0  ==>  Ordinary TB
#  1  ==>  TB plus U
#
# DataSet is the name of the subdirectory of the main directory in which the 
# data files are kept for the chosen model.

# assigned.

# this many K points (in reduced coordinates) with their weights (k1,k2,k3,wt)
# A value of -1 means that a Monkhorst-Pack mesh will be generated for you. You
# must provide three integers giving the number of points in each direction.

# and above those contributed by the neutral atoms.

# is required, then a line for each the spatial form and time dependence follows.
#
#  N  ==>  Number of fields.
# Spatial form:
#  0  ==>  Shift in onsite energy.
#          Followed by: atom index (1 to N) and shift amount (in Ry)
#  1  ==>  Sawtooth field (corresponding to uniform electric field)
#          Followed by direction (1=x, 2=y, 3=z) and field strength (in Ry/bohr)
# Time dependence:
#  0  ==>  Static

#  2  ==>  Periodic
#          Followed by: period (fs)
