# Platomic

Platomic is a graphical application built for Plato capable of quantitatively and qualitatively determining the electrical connectivity between atoms in molecules. It uses Plato's tight binding one script and the Hairy Probe method. This project was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the MSc degree in Computing Science of Imperial College London (2020-2021).

Runs purely on Python 3 (tested on 3.8.5). Requires a copy of Plato, which you can ask for permission from @horsfielda if you are part of his reseach group. Alternatively, you can obtain a license for it from [CPC Program Library](http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/). Once you have permission you may also contact me for a Platomic binary and install script, which includes Plato in binary form. Otherwise Platomic can be used with pre-computed Plato output files, a binary of Platomic excluding Plato is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gm_NhSlcpa8kAyH4iGcZiUyeAMKUJe6x/view?usp=sharing). A user guide which includes setup instructions, step by step walkthroughs and links to video walk-throughs is available in the doc directory.
