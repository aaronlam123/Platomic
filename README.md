# Platomic

Platomic is a graphical application built for Plato capable of quantitatively and qualitatively determining the electrical connectivity between atoms in molecules. It uses Plato's tight binding one script and the Hairy Probe method. This project was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the MSc degree in Computing Science of Imperial College London (2020-2021).

Runs purely on Python 3 (tested on 3.8.5). Requires a copy of the Plato, which you can ask for permission from @horsfielda, before contacting me for a Plato binary and install script (or you can instead install Plato manually).

Dependencies (tested on):
- PyQt5 (5.15.4)
- pyqtgraph (0.11.1)
- SciPy (1.5.2) 
- pandas (1.2.1)
- PyAutoGUI (0.9.52)
- PyOpenGL (3.1.5)
- NumPy (1.20.2)

System requirements for the Platomic binary (no install necessary, just run with ./main):
- Linux

System requirements for Platomic:
- Linux
- OSX
